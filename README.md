# Cookie Cutter projects

## ds

Data Science starter project incorporating best practices and ideas from my own
experience and around github.  The idea is to just use this "and go" for my
work with reasonable defaults.

```bash
cookiecutter ds
```

## py

Python starter project intended for use building generic python modules.  I
expect to add three additional baselines later for:

- microservice built on FastAPI (asynchronous)
- microservice built on Flask (synchronous)
- microservice depends on RabbitMQ or AWS SQS
