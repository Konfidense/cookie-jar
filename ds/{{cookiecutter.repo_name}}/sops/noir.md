# Statistical NOIR guidance

For quantifiable numerical data.

## Numerical

Categories with no inherent order or ranking.

Examples:

- gender
- ethnicity
- eye color

Properites of numerical data:

- no natural order
- categories are mutually exclusive
- only counts can be calculated
- mode is the only measure of central tendancy

## Ordinal

Categories with a meaningful order or rank where the difference between values
is the same regardless of magnitude.  Money cannot be Ordinal because the
difference between $1 and $10 isn't the same as $10 and $100.

Examples:

- movie ratings (1 star, 2 stars, etc)

Properties of ordinal data:

- natural order exists
- differences between values cannot be precisely evaluated

## Interval

Has equal intervals between values but no true zero point with a natural order.

Examples:

- dates (no true zero point; we cannot do meaningful ratios)
- temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit

Properties of interval data:

- natural order exists
- differences between values can be evaluated
- no meaningful ratio exists (e.g., 20 degrees celcius is not twice as hot as
  10 degrees celcius)

## Ratio data

Has equal intervals between values and a true zero point with a natural order.

Examples:

- height
- weight
- time
- money

Properties of ratio data:

- natural order exists
- differences and ratios are meaningful
- true zero point (e.g., zero weight means absence of weight)
