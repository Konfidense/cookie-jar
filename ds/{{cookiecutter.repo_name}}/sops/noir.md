# Statistical NOIR guidance

For quantifiable numerical data.

## Numerical

Categories with no inherent order or ranking.

Examples:

- gender
- ethnicity
- eye color

## Ordinal

Categories with a meaningful order or rank where the difference between values
is the same regardless of magnitude.  Money cannot be Ordinal because the
difference between $1 and $10 isn't the same as $10 and $100.

Examples:

- movie ratings (1 star, 2 stars, etc)


## Interval

Has equal intervals between values but no true zero point with a natural order.

Examples:

- temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit

## Ratio data

Has equal intervals between values and a true zero point with a natural order.

Examples:

- height
- weight
- time
- money
